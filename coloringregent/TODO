IO

Potential Optimizations: Combine steps that use interpidx. I think I can get rid of an entire 7d grid worth of memory.


Break up tasks for max parallelism -- change privileges to be field specific (mesh dimension, specific phi)

repartition to allow for parallelism across dimensions (gradients and gradients thereof)
