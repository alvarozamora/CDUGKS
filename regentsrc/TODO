IO

Potential Optimizations: Combine steps that use interpidx. I think I can get rid of an entire 7d grid worth of memory.

rewrite everything as space-first again. 
Done:
  task1a
  sigx
  sigy
  sigz
  sigxx
  sigyx
  sigzx
  sigxy
  sigyy
  sigzy
  sigxz
  sigyz
  sigzz
  task1c
  task2a
  task2b
  task2c


Break up tasks for max parallelism -- change privileges to be field specific (mesh dimension, specific phi)

repartition to allow for parallelism across dimensions (gradients and gradients thereof)
